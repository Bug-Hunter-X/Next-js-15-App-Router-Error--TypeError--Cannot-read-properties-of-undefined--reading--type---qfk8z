# Next.js 15 App Router Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')

This repository demonstrates a strange error encountered in Next.js 15's App Router. A simple functional component, without any external dependencies or complex logic, throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')` error.

## Bug Report

The issue arises when using a basic functional component as the default export in a page within the `app` directory.  The component itself is extremely simple; it only renders a single div element.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Next.js 15 application.
2. Replace the contents of `app/page.js` (or similar page file) with the provided `bug.js`.
3. Run the application (`npm run dev`).
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Expected Behavior

The application should render without error, displaying "Hello world".

## Actual Behavior

The application throws the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')`.

## Solution

The solution involves creating a simple layout file in `app/layout.js`. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
